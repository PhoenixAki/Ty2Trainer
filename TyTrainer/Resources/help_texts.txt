Determines the current Y position of a Bunyip. Y is considered to be height.
Determines the current Z position of a Bunyip. Z is considered to be up-down movement on minimaps.
Determines whether the player is currently playing as Ty, driving, etc.

Determines the current health of the Helicopter. Ranges from 0.0-1.0. Named "visual" because this doubles as both the internal health and how much the HUD health display is filled in.
Determines the current X position of the Helicopter. X is considered to be left-right movement on minimaps.
Determines the current Y position of the Helicopter. Y is considered to be height.
Determines the current Z position of the Helicopter. Z is considered to be up-down movement on minimaps.

Determines the current health of the Sub Bunyip. Ranges from 0.0-1.0. Named "visual" because this doubles as both the internal health and how much the HUD health display is filled in.
Determines the current X position of the Sub Bunyip. X is considered to be left-right movement on minimaps.
Determines the current Y position of the Sub Bunyip. Y is considered to be height.
Determines the current Z position of the Sub Bunyip. Z is considered to be up-down movement on minimaps.
Determines the current health of Shazza's Truck. Ranges from 0-20. The truck's internal health count has its own value separate from its visual value. Taking damage with this value set to 0 will not kill you - this is not a bug, just a quirk in how the game checks for death while driving.
Determines the portion of the HUD health display for Shazza's truck that is filled in currently. Ranges from 0.0-1.0.
Determines the current X position of Shazza's Truck. X is considered to be left-right movement on minimaps.
Determines the current Y position of Shazza's Truck. Y is considered to be height.
Determines the current Z position of Shazza's Truck. Z is considered to be up-down movement on minimaps.
Determines Ty's current grounded state. This value is 1 (TRUE) when Ty is on the ground, and 0 (FALSE) when in the air. Freezing this value at 1 is how the "Infinite Jump" feature of this trainer works. Enabling "Infinite Jump" makes it so Ty can jump again repeatedly when already in the air. Because the game will still attempt to make Ty lose height, it is recommended to lock his Y position once at the desired height.
Determines Ty's current health. This value ranges from 0 to either 4, 8, or 12, depending on if any of the health upgrades are purchased.
Determines the current speed cap of Ty's horizontal (X/Z) movement. Ty's current horizontal speed gradually increases until it reaches this value. This is more useful to set to a high value than Ty's actual speed, because you can control movement much better.
Determines whether Ty is currently swimming or not. This value is 1 (TRUE) when Ty is swimming, and 0 (FALSE) when not. Freezing this value at 0 is how the "Infinite Swim" feature of this trainer works. Enabling "Infinite Swim" makes Ty take no damage from air deprivation underwater, allowing you to swim infinitely.
Determines the current X position of Ty. X is considered to be left-right movement on minimaps.
Determines Ty's current X speed. If you want to increase Ty's movement speed, it is recommended to instead increase the Horiz. speed cap instead, as movement is easier to control.
Determines the current Y position of Ty. Y is considered to be height. If you want to float around levels, it is recommended to freeze this value at the height you want, and also freeze Ty's Y Speed to 0 for a smoother visual effect.
Determines Ty's current Y speed. Due to a quirk with how the game uses this value, you may have to jump before the effect of changing this value kicks in. Ty's speed as he glides is always locked to -330.
Determines the current Z position of Ty. Z is considered to be up-down movement on minimaps.
Determines Ty's current Z speed. If you want to increase Ty's movement speed, it is recommended to instead increase the Horiz. speed cap instead, as movement is easier to control.
Displays the total counts for 6 items on the total screen. Proper totals: Bilbies (30), Spies (25), Steves (10), Photos (175), Cogs (50), Orbs (30). Changing the top number directly affects the % counter. If you artifically increase the % counter to 100% and do the final mission, you will get the secret ending. NOTE: you must re-load the totals screen in order for your changes to show up.
